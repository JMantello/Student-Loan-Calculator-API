Student Loan Calculator Team 1 README

One of the projects worked on during my internship with Envestnet MoneyGuide was to create an API for our student loan calculator application. It uses ASP .NET to serve data to and from a MongoDB database, along with Entity Framework to model the data throughout the application.
